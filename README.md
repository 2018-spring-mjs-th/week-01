# week-01

For week-01 slack-and-tell, working in pairs if you like, starting with the guidance discussed in class, attempt to:

* Hook-up the add-quiz-behavior

* Make it easier and quicker to add many new quizzes
  * Think starting focus and state/focus of textbox after add
  * Maybe think of keyboard (E.g. ENTER to add) support
  
* What about delete-quiz-behavior ? ? ? Hmm...

## If still time (and interest), style our quiz list a bit...

* Hookup Bootstrap (via CDN)

* Change our `<ul>` to a `list-group` with `list-group-item`s
